- 👋 Hola, I’m @sb-347, i'm Italian and I'm 17. I'm actually studying at school and doing a little bit of coding.
It's the first time using github lol
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills in Python - Maths and computer science too, why not
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but I'm in highschool so I'm already busy (a lot)
- 💞️ I’m looking for a buddy who would like to set goals and work together and for experience
- 📫 I think you could contact me with github basically? Idk
